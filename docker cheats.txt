Working on docker images
===========================
1 To pull an image
  docker pull image_name

2 To push an image into docker hub
  docker push image_name

3 To search for an image
  docker search image_name

4 To delete an image frim the dockerhost
  docker rmi image_name/image_id

5 To create an image using a container
  docker commit container_name/container_id new_image_name

6 To create images from dockerfile
  docker build -t new_image_name .

7 To see the list of all the images present in the dockerhost
  docker images
  or
  docker image ls

9 To delete all the unused images
  docker system prune -a

10 To link an image with a localregistry(tag)
   docker tag image_name  localregistry/image_name

   docker images | grep localregistry


Working on docker containers
=================================
11 To see the list of all the runnig containers
   docker container ls

12 To see the list of all containers (running and stopped)
   docker ps -a

13 To start a stopped container
   docker start container_name/container_id

14 To stop a running container
   docker stop container_name/container_id

15 To restart a container
   docker restart container_name/container_id
   To restart a container after 20 seconds
   docker restart -t 20 container_name/container_id

16 To get detailed info about a container
   docker inspect container_name/container_id

17 To see the ports that are opened on the container
   docker port container_name/container_id

18 To see the logs genrated by the container
   docker logs container_name/container_id

19 To delete a stopped container
   docker rm container_name/container_id

20 To delete a running container
   docker rm -f container_name/container_id

21 To stop all the running container
   docker stop $(docker ps -aq)

22 To delete all stopped container
   docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

23 To delete all container(running and stopped)
   docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)

24 To create a container
   docker run image_name/image_id
   --name    Used to assing a name for the container
   -it       Used to open interactive terminal in the container
   -d        Used to run the container in detached mode so that the logs of the
             container dont come on the screen
   -v        Used to mount volumes on the container 
   --volumes-from   Used to share volumes between containers
   -p     Used for port mapping
          Eg : 8080:80   Here 8080 is the dockerhost port (external port) and 80 is the                container port(internal port)
   -P    Used for automatic port mapping where the container port will be mapped
          with some port no that is greate than 30000
  --network   Used to attach a network to the container
  --link      Used to link multiple containers to create a micro services architecture
  -e      Used to pass environment variables to the container
  --restart    Tries to do continuous restart if the container stops
  -rm        Removes a container once we exit from it
  --cpus    To put an upper limit on the count of cpus that the container can use
  --memory   To put an upper limit on the amount of rem used by container

25 To open termina in a contianer whcih has moved into background
   docker attach container_name/container_id

26 To run any other application or command in the container from outside
   docker exec -it  container_name/container_id command
   Eg To run bash process in aa container
   docker exec -it container_name/container_id bash

Docker Networking
=======================
25 To see the list of all the docker networks
   docker network ls

26 To create a network
   docker network create --driver network_type  network-name

27 To get detailed info about the network
   docker network inspect network_name/network_id

28 To connect a container to a docker network
   docker network connect  network_name/network_id  container_name/container_id

29 To disconnect a container from a network
   docker network disconnect  network_name/network_id  container_name/container_id

30 To delete  a network
   docker netwrok rm network_name/network_id

=================================================================================

Working on docker volumes
==========================
31 To see the list of docker volumes
   docker volume ls

32 To create a volume
   docker volume create volume_name

33 To get complete info about a volume
   docker volume inspect volume_name/volume_id

34 To delete a volume
   docker volume rm volume_name/volume_id
